I have developed an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe web application as part of my Web Development Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application allows users to play against each other or an AI opponent. It features functionalities to handle user clicks, track the game state, and check for winning conditions, ensuring an engaging and seamless gaming experience. Styled with a clean and responsive layout, the Tic-Tac-Toe game combines interactivity and visual appeal. This project enhanced my skills in logical programming, DOM manipulation, and building dynamic, user-centric web applications.
